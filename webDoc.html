        <!-- what actually was the process of making this website. maybe i just dont do that? i dunno there was a lot of blender modelling. maybe i just write a short paragraph about how i did it -->
        <p>im creating this page just to establish the fact that i actually MADE the whole THING!!!! im really pround of this project because everything is hand coded, and i got to explore 3js while drawing in 3d modelling skills and web design skills. </p>
        <p>this was a longterm project and im absolutely so proud that i finished it to my own standards for my art</p>
