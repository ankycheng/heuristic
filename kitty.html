    <p>Primarily, time was spent creating the assets for this video. A lot of time was also spent hand animating. I started out with the idea of synthesizing organic and geometric - the squishiness and wetness oft eh cats mouth, with the stark tile and harsh bulb lighting.</p>
    <p>Each of the photographic assets were colllaged from at least ten images found online, manipulated in Adobe Photoshop to create a sense of unity, like they are in the same space. Attention was also paid to the uniformity of the lineart (the cat animation is in one style, animation inside the mouth is in another), and the design of the eyeball and the figure.</p>
